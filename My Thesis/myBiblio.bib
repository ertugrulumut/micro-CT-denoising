An analysis of the local centre manifold yields a simple criterion for the existence and stability of super- and sub-threshold endemic equilibria for  near one. This criterion, together with the definition of , is illustrated by treatment, multigroup, staged progression, multistrain and vector–host models and can be applied to more complex models. The results are significant for disease control.}

This book combines traditional teaching on ordinary differential equations with an introduction to the more modern theory of dynamical systems, placing this theory in the context of applications to physics, biology, chemistry, and engineering. Beginning with linear systems, including matrix algebra, the focus then shifts to foundational material on non-linear differential equations, drawing heavily on the contraction mapping theorem. Subsequent chapters deal specifically with dynamical systems concepts - flow, chaos, invariant manifolds, bifurcation, etc. An appendix provides simple codes written in Maple®, Mathematica®, and MATLAB® software to give students practice with computation applied to dynamical systems problems. For senior undergraduates and first-year graduate students in pure and applied mathematics, engineering, and the physical sciences. Readers should be comfortable with differential equations and linear algebra and have had some exposure to advanced calculus.}

  abstract = {The basic reproduction number R0 is arguably the most important quantity in infectious disease epidemiology. The next-generation matrix (NGM) is the natural basis for the definition and calculation of R0 where finitely many different categories of individuals are recognized. We clear up confusion that has been around in the literature concerning the construction of this matrix, specifically for the most frequently used so-called compartmental models. We present a detailed easy recipe for the construction of the NGM from basic ingredients derived directly from the specifications of the model. We show that two related matrices exist which we define to be the NGM with large domain and the NGM with small domain. The three matrices together reflect the range of possibilities encountered in the literature for the characterization of R0. We show how they are connected and how their construction follows from the basic model ingredients, and establish that they have the same non-zero eigenvalues, the largest of which is the basic reproduction number R0. Although we present formal recipes based on linear algebra, we encourage the construction of the NGM by way of direct epidemiological reasoning, using the clear interpretation of the elements of the NGM and of the model ingredients. We present a selection of examples as a practical guide to our methods. In the appendix we present an elementary but complete proof that R0 defined as the dominant eigenvalue of the NGM for compartmental systems and the Malthusian parameter r, the real-time exponential growth rate in the early phase of an outbreak, are connected by the properties that R0 > 1 if and only if r > 0, and R0 = 1 if and only if r = 0.}

This volume surveys the current state of epidemic modeling in relation to basic aims such as understanding, prediction, and evaluation and implementation of control strategies. The book is divided into five parts, covering the conceptual framework, three major problem areas (space, nonlinearity, heterogeneity), and the direct relation of models to data. The contributors discuss a wide range of methodological issues, e.g. comparing different approaches to the modeling of heterogeneity and relations among different types of model; and different data analytic approaches, together with the availability and quality of the data they require.}

certain degree of cross-immunity to heterologous serotypes. Our model has
been constructed to study both the epidemiological trends of the disease and
conditions that permit coexistence in competing strains. Dengue is in the
Americas an epidemic disease and our model reproduces this kind of dynam-
ics. We consider two viral strains and temporary cross-immunity. Our analy-
sis shows the existence of an unstable endemic state (ÔsaddleÕ point) that
produces a long transient behavior where both dengue serotypes cocirculate.
Conditions for asymptotic stability of equilibria are discussed supported by
numerical simulations. We argue that the existence of competitive exclusion in
this system is product of the interplay between the host superinfection process
and frequency-dependent (vector to host) contact rates}

This book presents an overview and selected sample of these results and ideas, organized by biological theme rather than mathematical concept, with an emphasis on helping the reader develop appropriate modeling skills through use of well-chosen and varied examples.

Part I starts with unstructured single species population models, particularly in the framework of continuous time models, then adding the most rudimentary stage structure with variable stage duration. The theme of stage structure in an age-dependent context is developed in Part II, covering demographic concepts, such as life expectation and variance of life length, and their dynamic consequences. In Part III, the author considers the dynamic interplay of host and parasite populations, i.e., the epidemics and endemics of infectious diseases. The theme of stage structure continues here in the analysis of different stages of infection and of age-structure that is instrumental in optimizing vaccination strategies.

Each section concludes with exercises, some with solutions, and suggestions for further study. The level of mathematics is relatively modest; a "toolbox" provides a summary of required results in differential equations, integration, and integral equations. In addition, a selection of Maple worksheets is provided.

The book provides an authoritative tour through a dazzling ensemble of topics and is both an ideal introduction to the subject and reference for researchers.}
