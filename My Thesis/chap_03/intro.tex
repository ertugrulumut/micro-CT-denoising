\chapter{THRESHOLD DYNAMICS FOR A PERIODIC COMPARTMENTAL EPIDEMIC MODEL}
\label{chap:threshold}


In this chapter, we introduce the threshold dynamics for a compartmental epidemic model with the difference of periodic environment. In the previous chapter, disease transmisson model is considered for the autonomous case, however, in this chapter we analyze this model for the nonautonomous case based on the theory provided by Wang and Zhao~\cite{wz:08}.


%\section{Introduction}

In real life, many epidemic diseases show seasonal behavior for many reasons. For example, seasonal contact rates because of the opening and closing schools, periodic changes in birth rates and vaccination programs can be considered as a source of periodicity. Therefore, in order to analyze threshold dynamics for a disease transmisson, it is important to consider periodicity as well. We establish the basic reproduction ratio, defined in the preceeding chapter, for the periodic epidemic model and analyze the threshold dynamics of the periodic system.
